      "The question \"What is the meaning of life?\" is one of the most profound and enduring philosophical inquiries. Different traditions, philosophies, and individuals offer varied perspectives on this question. Here are some of the most common ways people approach it:\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. **Philosophical Perspectives**\n",
      "   - **Existentialism**: Life has no inherent meaning; it is up to each individual to create their own purpose through choices, actions, and commitments (e.g., Sartre, Camus).\n",
      "   - **Absurdism**: Life may lack intrinsic meaning, but humans can embrace the absurdity and find joy in the struggle (e.g., Albert Camus).\n",
      "   - **Stoicism**: The meaning of life lies in living virtuously, accepting what we cannot control, and focusing on reason and self-discipline.\n",
      "   - **Nihilism**: Life has no objective meaning, purpose, or value (though some nihilists find liberation in this idea).\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. **Religious/Spiritual Perspectives**\n",
      "   - **Theistic Views (Christianity, Islam, Judaism, etc.)**: The meaning of life is tied to a divine purpose—serving God, loving others, and achieving salvation or enlightenment.\n",
      "   - **Eastern Philosophies (Buddhism, Hinduism, Taoism)**: Meaning comes from liberation (moksha), enlightenment (nirvana), or harmony with the universe (Tao).\n",
      "   - **Pantheism/Panentheism**: The meaning of life is found in unity with the divine or the cosmos.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. **Scientific Perspectives**\n",
      "   - **Biological/Evolutionary**: Life’s \"purpose\" is survival, reproduction, and the propagation of genes (Richard Dawkins, evolutionary biology).\n",
      "   - **Cosmic Perspective**: From a vast, impersonal universe, life may have no inherent meaning—but that doesn’t negate personal or collective significance.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. **Humanistic Perspectives**\n",
      "   - **Personal Fulfillment**: Meaning comes from love, creativity, relationships, and self-actualization (e.g., Maslow, Carl Rogers).\n",
      "   - **Contributing to Society**: Many find purpose in helping others, advancing knowledge, or leaving a positive legacy.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5. **Pragmatic Answer**\n",
      "   - The meaning of life is whatever you choose to make it. It could be love, happiness, knowledge, family, art, service, or simply the experience of being alive.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Famous Quotes on the Topic:\n",
      "   - **Albert Camus**: \"The literal meaning of life is whatever you're doing that prevents you from killing yourself.\"  \n",
      "   - **Viktor Frankl**: \"Life is never made unbearable by circumstances, but only by lack of meaning and purpose.\"  \n",
      "   - **Douglas Adams (humorously)**: \"The answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything is 42.\"  \n",
      "\n",
      "### So, What’s the Answer?\n",
      "There is no single, universal answer—it’s a deeply personal question. Some find meaning in faith, others in relationships, work, or the pursuit of knowledge. The search itself can be meaningful.\n",
      "\n",
      "What resonates most with *you*?\n"
