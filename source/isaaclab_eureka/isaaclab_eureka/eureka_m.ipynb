      "The meaning of life is one of the most profound and debated questions in philosophy, religion, science, and personal reflection. There is no single, universally accepted answer, but here are some perspectives:\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. **Philosophical Perspectives**  \n",
      "   - **Existentialism (e.g., Sartre, Camus):** Life has no inherent meaning—we must create our own purpose through choices and actions.  \n",
      "   - **Absurdism (Camus):** The search for meaning in a meaningless universe is absurd, but we must embrace life regardless.  \n",
      "   - **Stoicism:** Meaning comes from living virtuously, accepting what we cannot control, and focusing on inner peace.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. **Religious/Spiritual Views**  \n",
      "   - **Theistic religions (Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, etc.):** Life’s purpose is tied to divine will—serving God, achieving enlightenment, or fulfilling dharma.  \n",
      "   - **Buddhism:** Meaning arises from ending suffering (dukkha) through enlightenment (nirvana) and compassion.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. **Scientific Perspectives**  \n",
      "   - **Evolutionary Biology:** Life’s \"purpose\" is survival and reproduction, but humans seek deeper significance beyond biology.  \n",
      "   - **Cosmic Perspective:** In a vast universe, meaning may derive from curiosity, exploration, or leaving a legacy.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. **Personal Meaning**  \n",
      "   Many find purpose in relationships, creativity, helping others, personal growth, or pursuing passions. Viktor Frankl (Holocaust survivor and psychiatrist) argued that meaning comes from suffering with dignity, love, and work.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### **A Practical Answer?**  \n",
      "You define your own meaning—whether through joy, contribution, learning, or connection. The journey itself may be the point.  \n",
      "\n",
      "What resonates with *you*? The search for meaning is deeply personal.\n"
