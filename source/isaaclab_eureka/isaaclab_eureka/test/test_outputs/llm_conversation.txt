user: I'll tell you where my friends are from. Later I'll ask you who is from where. You should remember the information I tell you. If I ask about a stranger, you should say I didn't tell you about them.
assistant: Understood! I'll remember the information you share about your friends. When you ask about someone later, I'll let you know where they're from based on what you've told me. If I don't have information on a person, I'll say so. Go ahead and tell me about your friends! ðŸ˜Š
