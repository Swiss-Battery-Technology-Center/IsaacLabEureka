### Summary of Success Metric and Auxiliary Fields

#### **Success Metric (`success_metric`)**  
**Physical Meaning**:  
The `success_metric` quantifies how well the end-effector (EE) is positioned near the screw (object) during the unscrewing task. It is a **smooth, continuous measure** ranging between `0` (failure) and `1` (success), where:  
- `1`: EE is **within** the target proximity (`offset` distance) of the screw.  
- `0`: EE is **far outside** the target proximity.  

**Computation**:  
1. **Distance Calculation**:  
   - Compute Euclidean distance between the EE and the screw's root position:  
     `dist = ||ee_pos_w - object_pos_w||`  
2. **Smooth Thresholding**:  
   - Apply a smooth transition using `tanh` centered at `offset`, scaled by `sigma`:  
     `step = (tanh((dist - offset) / sigma) + 1) * 0.5`  
   - `step` maps `dist` to `[0, 1]`, where:  
     - `step ≈ 0` when `dist ≪ offset` (EE is very close).  
     - `step ≈ 1` when `dist ≫ offset` (EE is far away).  
3. **Success Metric**:  
   - Invert `step` to align with intuitive success:  
     `success = 1 - step`  

**Key Parameters**:  
- `offset` (float): Target proximity threshold. EE must stay within this distance for high success.  
- `sigma` (float): Smoothness of the transition between success/failure. Smaller `sigma` = sharper transition.

#### **Auxiliary Fields**  
1. **`dist` (Mean Distance)**:  
   - **Physical Meaning**: Average Euclidean distance between EE and screw across environments.  
   - **Relation to Success Metric**: Directly inversely proportional to `success_metric`.  
     - Decreasing `dist` → Higher `success_metric`.  
     - Use this to diagnose whether low `success_metric` is due to poor EE positioning or overly strict `offset`/`sigma`.  

2. **`object_offset` (Object Position Offset)**:  
   - **Physical Meaning**: Offset applied to the screw’s root position (currently `(0, 0, 0)` in code).  
   - **Relation to Success Metric**:  
     - Non-zero values would indicate a shifted target position (e.g., for curriculum learning).  
     - Currently unused (`mean = 0`), but could signal misconfiguration if non-zero in training logs.

### Training Analysis & Recommendations  
#### **Interpreting Metrics**  
- **Ideal Progression**:  
  - `success_metric` ↑ + `dist` ↓ → Agent learns to position EE near the screw.  
  - Early training: Expect low `success_metric` and high `dist`.  
  - Mid/late training: `dist` should stabilize near or below `offset`.  

- **Common Issues**:  
  - **Plateaued `success_metric` with High `dist`**:  
    - Agent fails to approach the screw.  
    - **Fix**: Increase reward weight for `screw_engaged` term or simplify the task (e.g., larger initial `offset`).  
  - **High `success_metric` but Task Not Completed**:  
    - Metric is decoupled from actual unscrewing (e.g., no orientation tracking).  
    - **Fix**: Add orientation-based terms to the reward/success metric.  

#### **Reward Weight Tuning**  
- If `dist` decreases too slowly:  
  - Increase the weight of the `screw_engaged` reward term to prioritize EE positioning.  
- If `dist` oscillates:  
  - Reduce `sigma` to sharpen the success threshold, providing clearer gradients.  

#### **Curriculum Learning**  
- **Dynamic `offset`**:  
  - Start with a large `offset` (easy mode) and gradually reduce it to force precision.  
  - Example: `offset = 0.1 → 0.01` over 1M steps.  
- **Adaptive `sigma`**:  
  - Begin with large `sigma` (smooth rewards) and decrease it as training progresses to refine behavior.  

#### **Debugging via `object_offset`**  
- If `object_offset` becomes non-zero unexpectedly:  
  - Check for code/config errors altering the screw’s target position.  
  - Use this field to validate curriculum policies that dynamically shift the target.

This metric focuses **only on EE proximity**—combine it with orientation, force, or task-specific metrics (e.g., screw rotation angle) for a comprehensive success signal.
